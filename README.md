# variational-inf-for-HSMM

Adaptation of code from [pysvihmm ](https://github.com/dillonalaird/pysvihmm) by Nick Foti, Jason Xu and Dillon Laird to implement variational inference on Hidden Semi Markov Models using expansion formulation as described in Langrock, Zucchinni (2011).


The adapted code is converted to python 3 using `!2to3`
