This is a personal log of changes done to the original code set fo clarity and future work:

hmmbatchcd : changed the np.allclose() atol --> rtol (algorithm was terminating early resulting in )bad performance when convergence was slow in the first 10 steps (solves instability issues and allows for >500 iterations)

test_hmmbatchcd : changed data generating parameters during testing (no reason might change again)

test_hmmbatchsgd : modified sgd procedure, now using the pybasicbayes Gaussian method instead of util functions

experiments.ipynb : for initialization of priors set kappa_0 = 10 (high value) after implementing KMeans clustering for init mf_0 for known K  ðŸš¨ðŸš¨CONSULT IF IT IS CORRECT (VALID)ðŸš¨ðŸš¨

TO DO:
1. 	a) read sections 3,4 of supplementary 
	b) write them down for HSMM
2. 	a) write up in LaTeX what Benni wrote (notes) - use â€˜aâ€™ for dirichlet, alpha for FB pass
3.	plot covariances
4.	Add init with K-means clustering for stability  âœ…
	b) David - change initialization of kappa_0 on emmisions in SGD testing to see if stability improves
